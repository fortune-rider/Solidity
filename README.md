# Solidity functions

This is a simple program that does some basic functions such as minting tokens, burning tokens, etc. This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract shows the working of a few functions. This program serves as a simple introduction on how to execute the functions on the blockchain using solidity and can be used as a stepping stone for more complex projects in the future.

# Description

For this assessment, I have created a contract that does the following functions :

1. There is a mint function that takes two parameters: an address and a value. This function is a simple demonstration of how to mint tokens.
2. The next function we have is a burn function where we burn or destroy the tokens we have. A precaution we have to take in this function is to make sure that we 
   don't burn more tokens than we have
